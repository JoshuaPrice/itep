## ITEP: Pipeline for Inter-TAD and Intra-TAD Enhancer-Pormoter Analysis
This repo contains the code for my (Joshua Price) honors thesis in Molecular and Cell Biology at UC Berkeley, completed over the course of 2018. This project was conducted in the Tjian-Darzacq group at UC Berkeley under the generous guidance of Prof. Xavier Darzacq and graduate student Maxime Woringer. I wrote all of the code for the project (excluding external libraries) and completed the project from ideation of the research topic to submission of the thesis paper, which can be accessed here.
